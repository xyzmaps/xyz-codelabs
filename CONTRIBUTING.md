Before you contribute
Before we can use your code, you must sign the HERE Contributor License Agreement (CLA), which triggers automatically when you make a pull request. The CLA is necessary mainly because you own the copyright to your changes, even after your contribution becomes part of our codebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code. We also need to be sure of various other things -- for instance that you'll tell us if you know that your code infringes on other people's patents. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid frustration later on.

Content reviews
All submissions require review. We use Github pull requests for this purpose.
